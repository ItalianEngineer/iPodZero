# iPodZero
The code used for the iPodZero project

8.19.2023 - More work on clickwheel
Clickwheel not responding with NCMPCPP, but songs load and screen works.

8.20.2023 - Attempting a UI in Python that integrates clickwheel input

8.28.2023 - iPodZero is fully assembled, a few code touches to make such as better wheel response, button integration, and some UI touchups. I also added the file "hello.py" to utilize a package named "Click", which is not related to the clickwheel, rather command line interfaces. More info on the package at: https://pypi.org/project/click/

9.6.2023 - Added a new file, "iPodZeroTUI.c" for a better UI. It is terminal based to use less power, written in C, and is made to be integrated with Click.c from "retro-ipod-spotify-client" (dupontgu)

4.4.2024 - Working on V2 of the iPodZero, PCBs complete where testing can now begin. The project logs and details are now going to be on Gitbook, the link for that is here: https://app.gitbook.com/o/vFoeyleWgM5hSpKXToC9/s/K5IhbYxv9qNTssXZIEtV/
         - Refer to the Gitbook for any big changes in the project. If I have a minor change in the project, i.e., code uploads, bug fixes, etc. then they will be added here. The Gitbook contains cumulative progress of the project, pictures, and other resources.
