# iPodZero
The code used for the iPodZero project

8.19.2023 - More work on clickwheel
Clickwheel not responding with NCMPCPP, but songs load and screen works.

8.20.2023 - Attempting a UI in Python that integrates clickwheel input

8.28.2023 - iPodZero is fully assembled, a few code touches to make such as better wheel response, button integration, and some UI touchups. I also added the file "hello.py" to utilize a package named "Click", which is not related to the clickwheel, rather command line interfaces. More info on the package at: https://pypi.org/project/click/
